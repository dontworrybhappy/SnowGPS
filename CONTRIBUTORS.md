Jessica Cioffi:
I wrote the dijkstras algorithm, related the user's position and ideal endpoint to the mapped nodes, mapped the campus buildings, and helped with the video planning.

Ryan Michalec:
I created the web api, worked on dijkstras, and worked on convert.py.  

"Patricia Hale: I worked partially on dijkstras (setted up the format of the content being read in), mapped all pathes used in our graph, editted our demo, wrote primCheck to test if we have a connected graph, worked on convert.py to edit what vertices and edges were printed, and basically jumped between projects to help clean up things.

John Westhoff:
I worked on the front end web client, wrote maping.py, and made things play together on a server.
